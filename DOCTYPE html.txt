       <h2>Understanding Homelessness in France</h2>
      
       <p>Homelessness is a growing challenge in France, affecting over 120,000 people across the country. The issue extends far beyond a lack of shelter—it is a complex social problem with deep roots in economic disparity, mental health struggles, and lack of access to affordable housing. In major cities like Paris, Marseille, and Lyon, homelessness is becoming increasingly visible, but it’s not just an urban issue; rural areas are also seeing more families and individuals without stable homes.</p>
       <p>Despite efforts by the government and various organizations, homelessness is on the rise, and many individuals continue to face difficulties in accessing adequate support and services. It's vital that we not only focus on providing immediate shelter but also on long-term solutions that address the root causes of homelessness.</p>
   </section>


   <section>
       <h2>Causes of Homelessness</h2>
       <p>Homelessness is caused by a combination of factors, often interwoven and complex. The following are some of the key contributors to the rise in homelessness:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Poverty:</strong> A lack of stable income and access to affordable housing is a primary cause of homelessness. As housing costs rise in many French cities, more people find themselves unable to keep up with rent.</li>
           <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> The lack of steady employment, especially in areas with few job opportunities, makes it harder for individuals to maintain a stable living situation.</li>
           <li><strong>Health Issues:</strong> Mental health issues and substance abuse are common among the homeless population. These challenges often make it difficult for people to seek out help or maintain a stable life.</li>
           <li><strong>Family Breakdowns:</strong> For many, homelessness is a result of domestic violence or family issues. Women and children, in particular, are disproportionately affected.</li>
           <li><strong>Lack of Affordable Housing:</strong> The shortage of affordable housing across the country means that more people are forced to live in temporary, unsafe, or overcrowded conditions.</li>
       </ul>
   </section>


   <section>
       <h2>Impact of Homelessness</h2>
       <p>Homelessness doesn’t just affect individuals on the streets; it has a ripple effect on families, communities, and society as a whole. The impacts are wide-reaching and severe:</p>
       <ul>
           <li><strong>Health Consequences:</strong> People without homes are at a higher risk for both physical and mental health issues, including malnutrition, exposure to harsh weather, and untreated medical conditions. They may also face difficulty accessing necessary health services.</li>
           <li><strong>Social Stigma:</strong> Homeless individuals often face significant social stigma, making it harder for them to find work, secure housing, or reintegrate into society.</li>
           <li><strong>Strain on Public Services:</strong> As homelessness increases, it places additional pressure on emergency services, healthcare systems, and shelters, which are often already underfunded and overwhelmed.</li>
           <li><strong>Generational Poverty:</strong> Children who grow up in homeless situations are more likely to face long-term social and economic challenges, creating a cycle of poverty that is hard to break.</li>
       </ul>
   </section>

        <h2>Economic Impact</h2>
        <p>Homelessness has significant economic costs. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Public Health Costs:</strong> Homeless individuals often require more medical care due to exposure to the elements and untreated health conditions. Emergency healthcare services are a major expenditure.</li>

            <li><strong>Social Stigma:</strong> Homelessness can lead to isolation and discrimination. This stigma makes it harder for individuals to access housing, employment, and social services.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Strain:</strong> Homelessness can tear apart families and communities, causing long-term emotional and financial damage to everyone involved.</li>
